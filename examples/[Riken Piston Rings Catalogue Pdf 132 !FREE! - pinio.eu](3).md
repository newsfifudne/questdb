Piston rings are metal rings that fit into the grooves on the outer diameter of a piston in an engine. They have three main functions: sealing the combustion chamber to prevent gas leakage, transferring heat from the piston to the cylinder wall and regulating the oil consumption. Piston rings are subject to high pressure, temperature and friction, so they need to be made of high-strength materials and coated with high-quality coatings. Piston rings also need to have low ring tension to reduce energy loss and low engine oil consumption to prevent excess emissions.
