## What is MATLAB R2009a License File 12?
 
MATLAB R2009a license file 12 is a network license file that allows you to run MATLAB R2009a on multiple computers that are connected to a license server. The license server manages the distribution of license keys to the client computers. The license file contains the following information:
 
- The name and port number of the license server
- The product name, version, expiration date, and number of keys for each product
- The vendor string, asset info, issue date, borrow period, and signature for each product
- The comments that provide additional information about the license

Here is an example of an INCREMENT line in the license file that identifies a product:
 `INCREMENT MATLAB MLM 46 30-jan-2025 13 FDC7243F4976 \
VENDOR_STRING=vi=0:at=200:ae=1:lu=300:lo=CN:ei=1234567:lr=1:2p=0: \
DUP_GROUP=UH asset_info=123456 ISSUED=21-Nov-2021 BORROW=720 \
NOTICE=product=MATLAB SN=123456 SIGN="00C8 0547 EFDF 50D7 B9CE \
4C9D 3348 561B E9E3 6CCA 7986 C2F6 38C8 794F EE84"` 
This line indicates that the product name is MATLAB, the version is MLM 46 (R2009a), the expiration date is January 30, 2025, the number of keys is 13, and the other parameters are related to the vendor string, asset info, issue date, borrow period, and signature.

1. Download the network license manager installer from MathWorks website.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
3. When prompted, browse to your license file and select it.
4. The installer will make a copy of your license file named `license.dat`, process it to add the SERVER and DAEMON lines, and put it in the `/etc` folder where you are installing the network license manager.
5. The SERVER line identifies the server host and port number. The DAEMON line specifies the path to the lmgrd executable file.
6. The installer will also create a startup script named `lmstart` 8cf37b1e13
